Automated Tesing is a crucial aspect of software in general and specifically important for coding

In the basis of all automated tests are Unit Testing. Unit Testing verifies that that individual units of your code, usually a function or a class works & behaves as expected.

Unit Tesing is important since:
Software changes quickly when running Continuous Delivery - Unit Tests can help finding bugs and avoid regression
Unit Tests are also a good documentation tool
Unit Tests are also a good development tool
Unit Tests are also a good code design tool

At the heart of each unit test are the assertions. Assertions let you determine whether a specific test case (meaning a scenario which you expect to happen when you provide an input and run your function/class) had passsed or failed and usually provides more infomration as to why it failed/passed.

Most of the popular languages today have unit testing framewors that allows you to run tests & assertions easily. 

For Python, one of the frameworks is called Pytest and can be installed using pip:

`pip install pytest`
